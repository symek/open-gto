The GTO file format was invented at Tweak Films in 2002 to solve a variety of visual effects and computer graphics production needs. The format is simple, static, can store anything, and is an ideal format for exchanging data between facilities or between different phases of a production pipeline.

Continuous development since 2002 has improved performance, compression, and extended the ease of representation for a large variety of data types. ASCII versions of the format were introduced.

Future development will involve improved streaming, multiple object protocols, and import/export utilities for major vendor software tools.
